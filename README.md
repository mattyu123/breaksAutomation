# Oracle Breaks Automation

## Stack
This automation was coded with **Apps Script** on Google Sheets. The language used is Javascript. 

## Background
As part of Wealthsimple's operations, all transactions made on the crypto team are tracked and booked on an accounting ledger on Oracle. 

As part of our error resolution process, offset entries are occasionally required to fix previous entries. This automation will take the entry that was made in Oracle, and return the entries required to fix them. 

## User Experience


*Sensitive information has been removed from the code, including the names of the liquidity providers that Wealthsimple works with. They are referred to as LP1, LP2 and LP3 in the code.
